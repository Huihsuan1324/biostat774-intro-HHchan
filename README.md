# My introduction -- Huihsuan Chan

## About Me

I am Huihsuan Chan from Taiwan. I did my undergraduate in Pharmacy in Taipei Medical University. However, being a pharmacist is so boring. I decided to started my career in pharmaceutical industry. During past four years in pharma industry, I learned how to license drugs, and I understood how the healthcare market works. In order to catch up the big data trend, pharma companies started to promote and mange their customers through digital stuff. I realized that now is a big data time, I have to learn something.
